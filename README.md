# Assembler
This project is an essential part of another 42 school project([Corewar](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Core_War)) which was made with a group of students during my studing at 42.
The goal of this module is to be a translator from pseudo-assembler to pseudo-byte code. At some degree is a humble attempt to mimic some functionality of [GNU as command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/as).
