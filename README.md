# Assembler
This project is an essential part of another project([Corewar](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Core_War)) which was made with a group of students during my studying.
The goal of this module is to be a translator from pseudo-assembler to pseudo-byte code. At some degree is a humble attempt to mimic some functionality of [GNU as command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/as).

## Getting Started
TBD

## Coding style
C code has written following [Norminette](https://github.com/vsokh/assembler/blob/master/docs/norme.en.pdf)(42 code style specifications for almost all C-based projects) rules.
